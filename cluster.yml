#
# Order of deployment required to prevent chicken versus the egg issues:
#  0. For all deployment phases:
#       export AI_PROXY="${jumphost_name}"
#       export AI_INVENTORY="static_inventories/${cluster_name}_hosts.ini"
#       ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=".vault_pass.txt.${cluster_name}"
#  1. Use standard CentOS cloud image user 'centos' or 'root' user and without host key checking:
#       export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory.py -u centos -l 'jumphost,cluster'  single_role_playbooks/admin_users.yml
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory.py -u root   -l 'docs'              single_role_playbooks/admin_users.yml
#  2. Use local admin user's account and without host key checking:
#       export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory.py -u [admin_account] single_role_playbooks/ssh_host_signer.yml
#  3. Use local admin user's account and with strict host key checking to deploy everything else:
#       export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=True
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory.py -u [admin_account] cluster.yml
#     This will configure:
#       * Jumphost first as it is required to access the other machines.
#       * Repo management server second as it is required for version control of the packages
#         installed on all other machines except for the jumphost, which will always get the latest updates for security.
#       * Basic roles for all cluster machines part 1:
#           * Roles that do NOT require regular accounts or groups to be present.
#       * An LDAP with regular user accounts, which may be required for additional roles.
#             (E.g. a chmod or chgrp for a file/folder requires the corresponding user or group to be present.)
#       * Basic roles for all cluster machines part 2:
#           * Roles that DO depend on regular accounts and groups.
#       * SAI as it is required to:
#           * Configure layout on shared storage devices used by other machines.
#           * Configure Slurm control and Slurm database.
#       * DAI
#       * UI
#       * Compute nodes
#       * Documentation server
