The {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster is part of the league of robots - a collection of HPC clusters, 
which are named after robots.
Deployment and functional administration of all clusters is a joined effort of the
[Genomics Coordination Center (GCC)](http://wiki.gcc.rug.nl/)
and the 
[Center for Information Technology (CIT)](https://www.rug.nl/society-business/centre-for-information-technology/)
from the [University Medical Center](https://www.umcg.nl) and [University](https://www.rug.nl) of Groningen, 
in collaboration with and as part of several research projects including

* [ELIXIR compute platform](https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/compute)
* [EXCELERATE](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/excelerate)
* [Solve-RD - solving the unsolved rare diseases](http://solve-rd.eu/)
* [EJP RD - European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases](http://www.ejprarediseases.org/)
* [CORBEL](https://www.corbel-project.eu/home.html)
