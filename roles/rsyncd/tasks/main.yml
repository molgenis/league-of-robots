#
# Configure rsync deamon config file.
# * For use with rsync-only accounts that connect using a remote shell
#   and then spwan a single-use daemon server.
# * Hence there is no systemd managed rsyncd running constantly
#   and therfore no handler to (re)start a daemon.
#
# This role should not be confused with the rsync role, 
# which configures rsync on a managed host for use with the Ansible "ansible.posix.synchronize" task.
